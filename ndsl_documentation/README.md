# NDSL documentation

A space to keep early prototype technical documentation for the [NASA/NOAA DSL middleware](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL). This will mostly contain early drafts, prototypes, whitepapers, ... since design decisions should be documented (with the code) in the respective repository (e.g. [NDSL](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL) / [DaCe](https://github.com/spcl/dace) / [GT4Py](https://github.com/GridTools/gt4py/)).
