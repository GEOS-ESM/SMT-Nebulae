# Benchmark

- [ ] `BenchmarData` should become `Benchmark` and learn how to parse GEOS log
- [ ] After pillaging the code, remove `geos_log_parser.py`
- [ ] `Report` should be rolled in `Benchmark` too
- [ ] Create a `BenchmarkComparison` which outputs should be our way to report numbers. E.g.:
  - metrics
  - how to compare to benchmark
  - etc.
