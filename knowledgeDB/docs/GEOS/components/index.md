# GEOS component documentation

This part of the knowledge base holds GEOS documentation with things that we discover while porting. It is organized by component.

!!! Note

    Porting currently happens on the branch [`dsl/develop`](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm_GridComp/tree/dsl/develop) of [GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm_GridComp](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm_GridComp).
