# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a form of tech documentation specializing in storing decisions behind why a feature is built the way it is (and not in any other). They're supposed to capture the trade-offs and the reasoning at the time (or before) feature development.

Use the [_template](./_template.md) as a starting point.
