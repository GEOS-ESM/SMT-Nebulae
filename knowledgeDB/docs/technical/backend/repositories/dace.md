# DaCe development

[Docs](https://spcldace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [README](https://github.com/spcl/dace?tab=readme-ov-file#ace---data-centric-parallel-programming) | [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spcl/dace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Notes & quirks

- Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phschaad.sdfv)
- You can call `sdfg.view()` from the debugger to look at any (intermediate) SDFG with the VSCode plugin
- DaCe doesn't run the formatter automatically on the CI. You might see spurious formatting changes in your PRs (see [Discussion](https://github.com/spcl/dace/discussions/1804)).

## Community

- Weekly community meeting to discuss new features / big changes
