# DaCe development

[Docs](https://spcldace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [README](https://github.com/spcl/dace?tab=readme-ov-file#ace---data-centric-parallel-programming) | [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spcl/dace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Notes & quirks

- Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phschaad.sdfv)
- You can call `sdfg.view()` from the debugger to look at any (intermediate) SDFG with the VSCode plugin
- DaCe only enforces automatic formatting on the `main` branch. If you are working on `v1/maintenance`, you might see spurious formatting changes in your PRs (see [Discussion](https://github.com/spcl/dace/discussions/1804) and [this PR](https://github.com/spcl/dace/pull/1957)).

## Community
