# Development environment

This part of the documentation helps DSL developers to setup their environment. We collect [handy VSCode extensions](./vscode.md) and use it as a central place to define the [dev tech stack](./tech-stack.md).

As a reminder, DSL users are advised to stay with [released versions of NDSL](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL/releases/latest) unless they absolutely need one of the [experimental features](../frontend/experimental_features.md).
