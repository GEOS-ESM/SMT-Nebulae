# Technical documentation

This is technical part of the documentation, intended primarily for DSL developers (in contrast to DSL users). The docs here differentiate [frontend](./frontend/index.md) and [backend](./backend/index.md), give tips for your [development setup](./dev-setup/index.md) and include notes on the [translate tests system](./porting/translate_test.md) used to port FORTRAN code to NDSL.

We have many ideas on what to do in the future. Since the work is so fragmented, across repositories, we started a [laundry list](./laundry-list.md) in the hope keep things together in one place.
