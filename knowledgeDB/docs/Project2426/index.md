# 2024 - 2026: Proving NDSL for GEOS

The Software Modernization team proposes a two-year plan to prove the [NDSL](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL) technology at scale on NASA's [GEOS](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm) flagship model. The timeline of the project goes as follows:

The work is divided in 4 6-months milestone. As part of Milestone 1 (M1) the team as defined [science targets](./science-targets.md) and [HPC metrics](./hpc-metrics.md) that'll be reviewed for each benchmark.
