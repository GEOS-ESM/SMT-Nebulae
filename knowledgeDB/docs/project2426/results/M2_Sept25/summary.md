### Validation

_Numerical validation:_

Numerical validation is done comparing a single time step between Fortran and NDSL on the CPU. It was the base of the porting.

<INSERT PPT IMAGE TO SHOWCASE TRANSLATE TEST>

- Both codes run with `-O0`, e.g., with compiler optimization turned off.
- A multi-modal metric is used for measuring difference that combines absolute and relative differences, and ULP measurement.
- Differences are expected (compilers, different codes) and reasonable thresholding will be used.

_Scientific validation:_

Scientific validation is done by comparing the results of 7 days of GEOS runs.

See more details and discussion in the [overview](./validation_overview.md)

<TODO INSERT EXPLANATION ON METRICS USED RMSE, ETC.>

### Benchmark

Benchmark is done both on CPU and GPU at C180 L137. To showcase the difference in device bandwidth, we also run GPU on C720 L137.

Benchmark are done online in GEOS but measure several performance which are all interconnected
