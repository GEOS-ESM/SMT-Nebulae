# SMT Knowledge Base

We are the Software Modernization Team (SMT), part of [ASTG](https://astg.pages.smce.nasa.gov/website/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s Advanced Software Technology Group. Welcome to our knowledge base.

This knowledge base serves to document

- results & progress of the [24-26 project](./project2426/index.md)
- how to setup a development environment
- how to work with [GEOS](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm)
- notes on porting

and more. Easiest is to use the search function or browsing the navigation on the side.
